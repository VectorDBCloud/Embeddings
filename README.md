## Installation

To use these pre-computed embeddings in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VectorDBCloud/Embeddings.git
   cd Embeddings
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the desired embedding files using the links provided in the [Embeddings](#embeddings) section.

5. Place the downloaded embedding files in the appropriate directory within the project structure.

## Common Issues

1. **File Not Found Error**: Ensure that you've downloaded the embedding files and placed them in the correct directory.

2. **Memory Error**: Some embedding files are large and may cause memory issues on machines with limited RAM. Consider using a machine with more memory or processing the embeddings in smaller batches.

3. **Incompatible Numpy Version**: If you encounter issues loading the .npy files, ensure that you're using a compatible version of numpy. You can update numpy using `pip install --upgrade numpy`.

4. **Torch Version Mismatch**: For embeddings stored in .pt format, make sure your PyTorch version is compatible with the saved tensors. You may need to update PyTorch using `pip install --upgrade torch`.

5. **Slow Loading Times**: Large embedding files may take a while to load. This is normal, especially for the first load. Subsequent loads may be faster if the file is cached by your operating system.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using these embeddings, try the following steps:

1. **Check Your Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher. You can check your version with `python --version`.

2. **Verify File Integrity**: If you're having issues loading an embedding file, try re-downloading it. The file may have been corrupted during the download process.

3. **Check Available Disk Space**: Ensure you have enough free disk space to store and work with the embedding files.

4. **Update Dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are up to date. You can update all packages listed in requirements.txt with:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Loading Large Files**: If you're working with particularly large embedding files, consider using memory-mapping or lazy loading techniques. For example, with numpy:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   embeddings = np.load('path/to/large_embeddings.npy', mmap_mode='r')
   ```
6. **GPU vs CPU**: If you're working with PyTorch tensors and have a GPU available, you might want to move the embeddings to the GPU for faster processing:
   ```python
   import torch
   embeddings = torch.load('path/to/embeddings.pt')
   if torch.cuda.is_available():
       embeddings = embeddings.cuda()
   ```
   Conversely, if you're getting CUDA out of memory errors, you may need to move the embeddings to CPU:
   ```python
   embeddings = embeddings.cpu()
   ```

7. **Embedding Dimension Mismatch**: If you're getting dimension mismatch errors when using the embeddings, double-check that you're using the correct embedding file for your task and that your model is configured to expect the correct embedding size.

8. **File Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary read permissions for the embedding files. On Unix-based systems, you can change permissions with:
   ```
   chmod 644 path/to/embedding_file
   ```

9. **Encoding Issues**: If you encounter encoding errors when loading text-based embedding files, try specifying the encoding explicitly:
   ```python
   with open('path/to/embeddings.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       # Your loading code here
   ```

10. **Out of Memory Errors**: For very large embedding sets, you might need to process them in batches. Consider implementing a generator or iterator to load and process embeddings in smaller chunks.

If you've tried these troubleshooting steps and are still experiencing issues, please open an issue in the repository with a detailed description of the problem, including any error messages and the steps to reproduce the issue.
