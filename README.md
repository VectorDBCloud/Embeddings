## About

This repository serves as a centralized resource for pre-computed embeddings that can be directly used with vector databases. These embeddings are generated using popular models and datasets, and are intended to save time and computational resources for users.

## How to Contribute

We encourage contributions of new embeddings or improvements to existing ones. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Add Your Embeddings**: Create a directory for your embeddings. Include the embedding files, a README with details on the model and dataset used, and usage instructions.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request for review and inclusion.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure embeddings are created using properly licensed datasets and models.
- Include clear documentation, detailing the model used, dataset, and potential use cases.
- Provide links to relevant papers or resources if applicable.

## Embeddings

### Text Embeddings

- **[BERT Base Uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)**  
  *Description*: Pre-computed embeddings from the BERT Base Uncased model, ideal for NLP tasks requiring context-aware representations.  
  *Usage*: Suitable for semantic search and sentence classification.  
  *Link to Embeddings*: [Download Embeddings](https://example.com/bert-base-uncased-embeddings)

- **[Sentence-BERT (SBERT)](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/bert-base-nli-mean-tokens)**  
  *Description*: Sentence embeddings derived from SBERT, optimized for semantic textual similarity tasks.  
  *Usage*: Effective for sentence-level semantic search and clustering.  
  *Link to Embeddings*: [Download Embeddings](https://example.com/sbert-embeddings)

### Image Embeddings

- **[ResNet-50](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50)**  
  *Description*: Embeddings generated from the ResNet-50 model, commonly used for image recognition tasks.  
  *Usage*: Ideal for image similarity search and object recognition.

- **[CLIP (ViT-B/32)](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32)**  
  *Description*: Multimodal embeddings from CLIP, which encodes images and text into a shared embedding space.  
  *Usage*: Useful for cross-modal retrieval tasks.

### Multimodal Embeddings

- **[VisualBERT](https://huggingface.co/uclanlp/visualbert-nlvr2-coco-pre)**  
  *Description*: Embeddings that combine visual and textual information, suitable for multimodal tasks.  
  *Usage*: Good for visual question answering and captioning.

- **[VilBERT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/vilbert-multi-task)**  
  *Description*: Embeddings from the VilBERT model, designed for understanding visual and language inputs together.  
  *Usage*: Effective for tasks that require joint vision-language understanding.
